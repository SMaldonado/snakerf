# snakerf

A mediocre collection of RF/analog circuits scripts. Until this README is updated please don't judge the actual software content of this repository too much.

The design intent of this set of scripts is to:
- Fill a perceived gap in scikit-rf, which abstracts RF circuits into matrices of S/X/Y/Z parameters and is poorly suited to tasks like designing matching networks
- Make up for (LT)Spice's poor handling of scattering parameters and general clunkiness
